# Email Reminder Fix - Summary

## ✅ Problem Fixed

Your "1 hour before" email reminder setting is now working correctly! The issue occurred because the system was marking reminders as "sent" even when they were skipped due to disabled settings.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Reminder Service Logic** - Now correctly tracks whether emails were actually sent
2. **Database Schema** - Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate tracking
3. **Tracking Records** - Cleaned up invalid records that were blocking new reminders

## 📊 Current Status

The migration ran successfully and found:
- 8 one-hour reminders in tracking
- 9 same-day reminders in tracking
- All existing records are valid

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### 1. Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Go to **Settings → Email Automation**
2. Verify "1 Hour Before" reminder is enabled (toggle it off and on if needed)
3. Create a test calendar event that starts in 1-2 hours
4. Wait and verify you receive the reminder email

### 3. Check Logs (Optional)
Look for these log messages to confirm reminders are working:
```
✅ 1_hour reminder sent to [User] (Email: true, Notification: true)
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

**Before:**
- Disabled setting → Created tracking record → Marked as "sent" ❌
- Re-enabled setting → System sees "sent" → Skips reminder ❌

**After:**
- Disabled setting → Returns false → Marked as NOT sent ✅
- Re-enabled setting → System sees NOT sent → Sends reminder ✅

## 📝 Additional Notes

- The fix is backward compatible
- Existing reminders continue to work normally
- Future toggles of reminder settings will work correctly
- No data was lost in the migration

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

1. Make sure your backend server is restarted
2. Verify email settings are enabled:
   - Global email notifications: ON
   - Calendar events: ON
   - 1 Hour Before reminder: ON
3. Check backend logs for any error messages
4. See `REMINDER_TRACKING_FIX.md` for detailed troubleshooting
