## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Referral Tracking
- Automatically creates referral records when leads are assigned to agents
- Tracks referral date for accurate timing calculations
- Maintains complete referral history for each lead

### 2. 1-Month Commission Rule
- **Within 1 month**: Previous referrer maintains commission eligibility
- **After 1 month**: Previous referrer loses commission eligibility (marked external)
- New agent always gets internal referral (earns commission)

### 3. Visual Referral Display
- Clear visual indicators for current, internal, and external referrals
- Chronological display of referral history
- Explanation of why referrals are marked external
- Commission summary for each lead

### 4. API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/leads/:id/referrals              - Get referral history
GET  /api/leads/agent/:agentId/referral-stats - Get agent statistics
```

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### New Table: lead_referrals
```sql
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- lead_id (FOREIGN KEY → leads)
- agent_id (FOREIGN KEY → users)
- referral_date (TIMESTAMP)
- external (BOOLEAN)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMPS)
- UNIQUE constraint on (lead_id, agent_id)
```

### Modified Table: referrals (properties)
```sql
+ external (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
```

## 🔧 Key Algorithms

### Lead Reassignment Processing
```javascript
1. Get most recent internal referral for the lead
2. Calculate days since that referral
3. If > 30 days: Mark as external
4. If ≤ 30 days: Keep as internal
5. Create new internal referral for new agent
```

### Commission Status Determination
```javascript
external = false → Agent earns commission
external = true  → Agent does not earn commission
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations successfully
- [ ] Create a new lead and verify referral is created
- [ ] Reassign lead within 1 month - verify both referrals are internal
- [ ] Reassign lead after 1 month - verify first referral becomes external
- [ ] View lead details - verify referral section displays correctly
- [ ] Check API endpoints return correct data
- [ ] Verify permissions are enforced correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple reassignments
- [ ] Verify referral statistics are accurate

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Automated Commission Tracking**: No manual tracking needed
2. **Fair Commission System**: Clear rules for commission eligibility
3. **Transparency**: All referral history is visible
4. **Historical Record**: Complete audit trail of lead assignments
5. **Scalability**: Handles multiple reassignments efficiently

## 🔄 Workflow Example

```
Day 1:  Create Lead → Assign to Agent A
        ✅ Agent A: Internal referral (earns commission)

Day 15: Reassign to Agent B
        ✅ Agent A: Still internal (earns commission)
        ✅ Agent B: New internal (earns commission)
        📊 Result: Both earn commission

Day 45: Reassign to Agent C
        ⚠️ Agent A: Now external (no commission)
        ✅ Agent B: Still internal (earns commission)
        ✅ Agent C: New internal (earns commission)
        📊 Result: B and C earn commission, A does not
```

## 💡 Usage Tips
