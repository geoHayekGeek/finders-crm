# Reminder Settings Issue - Investigation Results

## Issue Reported
**User:** "I turned off same day email automation but now 1 hour before is not working even though it's enabled"

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Database Settings Verified
```
reminder_1_day_before: ✅ ENABLED (value: "true")
reminder_same_day: ❌ DISABLED (value: "false")  
reminder_1_hour_before: ✅ ENABLED (value: "true")
```

### ✅ Logic Check Verified
All three checks pass for 1-hour reminders:
- Global Email: ✅ ENABLED
- Calendar Events: ✅ ENABLED  
- Reminder Type (1_hour): ✅ ENABLED
- **Result: WOULD SEND EMAIL: ✅ YES**

### ⏰ How 1-Hour Reminders Work

The 1-hour reminder system works with a **10-minute trigger window**:

1. **Trigger Window:** Events 55-65 minutes before start time
2. **Processing:** Reminder service runs every 1 minute via cron job
3. **Sending:** Email sent when event enters the 55-65 minute window

### 📅 Current Event Status

**"Gio" Event:**
- Starts in: 49 minutes
- Status: ⚠️ **PAST trigger window** (55-65 minutes)
- Reminder Status: Already sent (Email ✅, Notif ✅)

## Why It Might Seem Like It's Not Working

### Scenario 1: Event Already Past Window
- If you create/check an event that's less than 55 minutes away
- The 1-hour reminder window has already passed
- **Solution:** Create a new event 2+ hours in the future to test

### Scenario 2: Reminder Service Not Running
- The reminder service needs to be running via cron job
- Check if `reminderScheduler` is started in your server
- **Solution:** Ensure reminder scheduler is running

### Scenario 3: Event Created Outside Window
- If event is created less than 65 minutes before start
- 1-hour reminder might not be scheduled properly
- **Solution:** System will catch it on next run if in window

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Test with New Event
```bash
# Create a calendar event 2 hours from now
# Wait and check if 1-hour reminder arrives when event is ~1 hour away
```

### 2. Manually Run Reminder Service
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/reminderManager.js run
```

### 3. Check Reminder Tracking
```sql
SELECT 
  rt.event_id,
  ce.title,
  rt.reminder_type,
  rt.email_sent,
  rt.scheduled_time,
  ce.start_time
FROM reminder_tracking rt
JOIN calendar_events ce ON ce.id = rt.event_id
WHERE rt.reminder_type = '1_hour'
  AND ce.start_time > NOW()
ORDER BY ce.start_time;
```

### 4. Verify Scheduler is Running
Check your server logs for:
```
⏰ Running reminder check...
📋 Found X events needing reminders
```

## Conclusion

**Settings are CORRECT** ✅

The 1-hour reminder is:
- ✅ Enabled in database
- ✅ Would send emails (all checks pass)
- ✅ Working correctly (tracking shows sent reminders)

**Likely Issue:**
- Event is outside the 55-65 minute trigger window
- Or reminder service isn't running
- Or testing with events too close to start time

## Recommended Action

1. **Create a test event 2-3 hours from now**
2. **Verify reminder scheduler is running**
3. **Wait and check email when event is ~1 hour away**

The system is working correctly based on database verification! 🎯
