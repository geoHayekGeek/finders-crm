# Lead Referral External Logic - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The 30-day external referral rule has been successfully implemented for the Finders CRM lead referral system.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Logic Updates**

#### `processLeadReassignment()` - Enhanced
**File:** `backend/models/leadReferralModel.js`

**Changes:**
- Now marks **ALL** internal referrals older than 30 days as external (not just the most recent one)
- Properly handles chain referral scenarios
- Uses `>= 30` days threshold for consistency

**Before:**
```javascript
// Only checked the most recent referral
const recentReferral = /* get one referral */
if (daysSinceReferral > 30) {
  // mark only that one as external
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Check ALL internal referrals
const internalReferrals = /* get all internal referrals */
for (const referral of internalReferrals) {
  const daysSinceReferral = /* calculate */
  if (daysSinceReferral >= 30) {
    // mark as external
  }
}
```

---

#### `applyExternalRuleToLeadReferrals()` - New Method
**File:** `backend/models/leadReferralModel.js`

**Purpose:** Apply the 30-day rule to all referrals for a lead, comparing against the most recent referral.

**Logic:**
1. Get all referrals for a lead (sorted newest → oldest)
2. Most recent referral is always internal
3. Any referral 30+ days older than the most recent → external
4. Any referral < 30 days from most recent → internal

**Use Cases:**
- Manual referral creation/updates
- Bulk processing
- Correcting referral statuses

---

### 2. **Controller Integration**

#### `createLead()` - Updated
**File:** `backend/controllers/leadsController.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
// After creating manual referrals
await LeadReferral.applyExternalRuleToLeadReferrals(newLead.id);
```

**Effect:** When creating a lead with multiple referrals at different dates, the external rule is automatically applied.

---

#### `updateLead()` - Updated
**File:** `backend/controllers/leadsController.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
// After updating manual referrals
await LeadReferral.applyExternalRuleToLeadReferrals(parseInt(id));
```

**Effect:** When updating referrals (including dates), the external rule is automatically recalculated.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Test Script Created
**File:** `backend/test-external-referral-logic.js`

**Scenarios Covered:**
1. ✅ Single initial referral (should be internal)
2. ✅ Re-referral after 1 month (old becomes external)
3. ✅ Re-referral within 1 month (both remain internal)
4. ✅ Multiple chain referrals (all old ones become external)
5. ✅ Manual referrals with mixed dates (automatic rule application)

**To Run Tests:**
```bash
cd backend
node test-external-referral-logic.js
```

## 📊 How It Works in Practice

### Example Timeline

```
Jan 1:  Alice refers lead → Bob
        [Alice: internal ✅]

Feb 10: Bob refers lead → Carol (40 days later)
        [Alice: external ❌] (marked automatically)
        [Bob: internal ✅]

Mar 22: Carol refers lead → Dave (40 days later)
        [Alice: external ❌]
        [Bob: external ❌] (marked automatically)
        [Carol: internal ✅]
```

### Database State

```sql
-- After Mar 22
SELECT * FROM lead_referrals WHERE lead_id = 123;

id | agent_id | name   | referral_date | external
---|----------|--------|---------------|----------
 1 |    1     | Alice  | 2025-01-01    | true
 2 |    2     | Bob    | 2025-02-10    | true
 3 |    3     | Carol  | 2025-03-22    | false
```

## 🔄 Automatic Triggers

The external rule is automatically applied in these scenarios:

### 1. **Agent Reassignment**
```javascript
// User updates lead and changes agent_id
PUT /api/leads/123
{
  "agent_id": 5  // Changed from 4
}

// Backend automatically:
// 1. Calls processLeadReassignment()
// 2. Marks old referrals as external (if >= 30 days)
// 3. Creates new internal referral for agent 5
```

### 2. **Manual Referral Creation**
```javascript
// User creates lead with multiple referrals
POST /api/leads
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "referrals": [
    { "employee_id": 1, "date": "2024-12-01" },  // 80 days ago
    { "employee_id": 2, "date": "2025-01-15" }   // 45 days ago
  ]
}

// Backend automatically:
// 1. Creates both referrals
// 2. Calls applyExternalRuleToLeadReferrals()
// 3. Marks first referral as external
```

### 3. **Manual Referral Update**
```javascript
// User updates referral dates
PUT /api/leads/123
{
  "referrals": [
    { "employee_id": 1, "date": "2025-01-01" },  // Updated date
    { "employee_id": 2, "date": "2025-02-15" }
  ]
}

// Backend automatically:
// 1. Deletes old referrals
// 2. Creates new referrals
// 3. Calls applyExternalRuleToLeadReferrals()
// 4. Recalculates external status based on new dates
```

- Triggers on agent reassignment
- Triggers on referral create/update

### ✅ Chain Case Handling
- Properly handles multiple sequential referrals
- Each referral is evaluated independently
- All old referrals are marked external (not just one)

### ✅ Date-Based Logic
- Uses actual referral dates (not creation dates)
- Compares against most recent referral
- Uses >= 30 days threshold

### ✅ Transaction Safety
- All operations wrapped in database transactions
- Rollback on error
- Data consistency guaranteed

### ✅ Comprehensive Logging
- Detailed console logs for debugging
- Shows which referrals are marked external
- Displays age of each referral

## 🔍 Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Multiple Referrals Created Simultaneously
**Scenario:** Lead created with 3 referrals on same date
**Result:** All remain internal (0 days difference)

### Case 2: Exactly 30 Days
**Scenario:** Referral is exactly 30 days old
**Result:** Marked as external (`>= 30` days)

### Case 3: Custom (Non-Employee) Referrals
**Scenario:** Mix of employee and custom referrals
**Result:** Rule applies to all types equally

### Case 4: No Existing Referrals
**Scenario:** First referral for a lead
**Result:** Created as internal, no others to mark

### Case 5: Referral Date Updated to Recent
**Scenario:** Old external referral date updated to within 30 days
**Result:** Marked back as internal automatically

## 📈 Commission Eligibility Query

To get all agents earning commission for a lead:

```sql
SELECT 
  lr.id,
  lr.agent_id,
  u.name as agent_name,
  lr.referral_date,
  lr.external
FROM lead_referrals lr
LEFT JOIN users u ON lr.agent_id = u.id
WHERE lr.lead_id = $1 
  AND lr.external = FALSE
ORDER BY lr.referral_date DESC;
```

## 🎓 For Future Developers

### To understand this feature:
1. Read `LEAD_REFERRAL_EXTERNAL_LOGIC.md` (comprehensive guide)
2. Review `backend/models/leadReferralModel.js` (core logic)
3. Run `backend/test-external-referral-logic.js` (see it in action)

### To modify the 30-day threshold:
Search for `>= 30` in:
