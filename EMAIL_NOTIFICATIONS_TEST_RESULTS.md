## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Enable 1 Hour Before Reminder** (currently disabled)
   - Go to Settings → Email Automation
   - Enable "1 Hour Before" reminder
   - Most useful for urgent reminders

2. **Test Calendar Event Reminders**
   - Create a calendar event 2 hours from now
   - Should receive "1 Hour Before" email (if enabled)
   - Check reminder tracking in database

3. **Monitor Email Logs**
   - Check backend console for email sending activity
   - Look for "✅ Email reminder sent" messages
   - Verify no errors in SMTP communication

4. **Consider Implementing Other Notification Types**
   - If you need email notifications for viewings/properties/leads/users
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours for all types
   - Would require email templates and settings checks

### For Better Email Deliverability

1. **Use Custom Domain Email** (Optional)
   - Instead of Gmail: noreply@yourdomain.com
   - Better for professional communications
   - Consider SendGrid, AWS SES, or Mailgun

2. **Add Reply-To Address** (Optional)
   - Currently using noreply@ which can't be replied to
   - Could add support@yourdomain.com as reply-to

3. **Email Tracking** (Optional)
   - Add open/click tracking
   - Monitor delivery rates
   - Track bounce rates

## Testing Commands

### Check Current Reminders
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/check-reminders.js
```

### Test Email System
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test-email-notifications.js
```

### Fix Email From Address

```

## Email Inbox Check

**Check your email inbox for:**
1. ✉️ Test Email - "Email Configuration Test"
2. ✉️ Calendar Reminder - "🚨 Reminder: Test Calendar Event - Starting Soon"

Both should have been delivered to: **georgiohayek2002@gmail.com** or **admin@finderscrm.com**

## Database Verification

### Check Email Settings
```sql
SELECT setting_key, setting_value, category 
FROM system_settings 
WHERE category = 'email' 
ORDER BY setting_key;
```

### Check Reminder Tracking
```sql
SELECT 
  rt.id,
  ce.title as event_title,
  rt.reminder_type,
  rt.email_sent,
  rt.notification_sent,
  rt.created_at
FROM reminder_tracking rt
JOIN calendar_events ce ON ce.id = rt.event_id
ORDER BY rt.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Upcoming Events
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  start_time,
  start_time - NOW() as time_until
FROM calendar_events 
WHERE start_time > NOW() 
ORDER BY start_time
LIMIT 5;
```

## Known Issues
