# Reports Page Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive Reports page has been successfully implemented for the Finders CRM system, featuring a tabbed interface with the fully functional "Monthly Agent Statistics" tab.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Table**: `monthly_agent_reports`
- **Fields**:
  - Agent information and time period (month/year)
  - Auto-calculated metrics:
    - Listings count
    - Lead sources (dynamic JSONB field)
    - Viewings count
    - Sales count and amount
    - Commission calculations (agent, finders, referral, TL, admin)
    - Total commission
    - Referrals received
  - Manual field: Boosts (editable)
- **Features**:
  - Unique constraint per agent/month/year
  - Automatic timestamp updates
  - Indexes for performance

### 2. Backend API

#### Models (`backend/models/reportsModel.js`)
- `createMonthlyReport()` - Create new report with auto-calculations
- `calculateReportData()` - Calculate all metrics from database
- `recalculateReport()` - Refresh calculations while preserving manual fields
- `getAllReports()` - Get reports with optional filters
- `getReportById()` - Get single report details
- `updateReport()` - Update manual fields
- `deleteReport()` - Remove a report
- `getAvailableLeadSources()` - Get lead source list

#### Controller (`backend/controllers/reportsController.js`)
- RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Validation and error handling
- Success/error responses

#### Routes (`backend/routes/reportsRoutes.js`)
- `GET /api/reports/monthly` - Get all reports (with filters)
- `GET /api/reports/monthly/:id` - Get single report
- `POST /api/reports/monthly` - Create new report
- `PUT /api/reports/monthly/:id` - Update report
- `POST /api/reports/monthly/:id/recalculate` - Recalculate values
- `DELETE /api/reports/monthly/:id` - Delete report
- `GET /api/reports/lead-sources` - Get available lead sources

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Main Page (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)
- Tab-based navigation
- 4 tabs defined (only first one active):
  1. **Monthly Agent Statistics** (fully implemented)
  2. Leads Report (coming soon)
  3. Revenue Report (coming soon)
  4. Performance Report (coming soon)
- Protected route requiring agent performance viewing permission

#### Monthly Agent Stats Tab (`frontend/src/components/reports/MonthlyAgentStatsTab.tsx`)

  - Comprehensive data table with dynamic lead source columns
  - Inline editing for "Boosts" field
  - Recalculate button per row
  - Delete functionality
  - Export to CSV
  - Refresh data
  - Create new report button

  - Listings count
  - Dynamic lead sources (Dubizzle, Facebook, Instagram, Website, TikTok, etc.)
  - Viewings count
  - Boosts (editable inline)
  - Sales count
  - Sales amount
  - Agent Commission
  - Finders Commission
  - Referral Commission
  - Team Leader Commission
  - Administration Commission
  - Total Commission
  - Referrals Received
  - Actions (Recalculate, Delete)

#### Filters Component (`frontend/src/components/reports/ReportsFilters.tsx`)
- **Filter Options**:
  - Agent dropdown (agents and team leaders)
  - Month dropdown (all 12 months)
  - Year dropdown (last 10 years)
- Active filters display with remove badges
- Clear all filters button
- Consistent design with other pages

#### Create Report Modal (`frontend/src/components/reports/CreateReportModal.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Agent selection dropdown
  - Month/Year selection (defaults to previous month)
  - Optional Boosts input
  - Validation for duplicate reports
  - Auto-calculation notification
  - Report summary preview
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. Types and Utilities

#### Types (`frontend/src/types/reports.ts`)
```typescript
- MonthlyAgentReport
- ReportFilters
- CreateReportData
- UpdateReportData
- ReportFormData
```

#### API Functions (`frontend/src/utils/api.ts`)
```typescript
reportsApi.getAll()
reportsApi.getById()
reportsApi.create()
reportsApi.update()
reportsApi.recalculate()
reportsApi.delete()
reportsApi.getLeadSources()
```

#### Formatters (`frontend/src/utils/formatters.ts`)
```typescript
formatCurrency()
formatNumber()
formatPercentage()
formatBytes()
truncateString()
```

### 5. Navigation Integration
- Added "Reports" link to dashboard navigation
- Icon: BarChart3
- Visible to users with `canViewAgentPerformance` permission
- Positioned between Calendar and HR in navigation

## How It Works

### Data Calculation Logic

When a report is created or recalculated:

1. **Listings**: Count properties created by agent in the month
2. **Lead Sources**: Group and count leads by reference source (dynamic)
3. **Viewings**: Count viewings conducted by agent
4. **Sales**: Count properties with `closed_date` in the month and status "sold" or "rented"
5. **Sales Amount**: Sum of prices from closed properties
6. **Commissions**: Calculate based on percentages from system settings
7. **Referrals Received**: Count properties where agent received referrals

### Commission Calculation

Commissions are calculated as percentages of sales amount:
- Agent Commission: `sales_amount × agent_percentage`
- Finders Commission: `sales_amount × finders_percentage`
- Referral Commission: `sales_amount × referral_percentage`
- Team Leader Commission: `sales_amount × team_leader_percentage`
- Administration Commission: `sales_amount × administration_percentage`
- Total Commission: Sum of all commissions

Percentages are pulled from system settings.

### Dynamic Lead Sources

Lead sources are stored as JSONB and displayed dynamically:
- Sources appear as columns automatically
- New sources are added when they appear in data
- Handles missing sources gracefully (shows 0)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

Run the SQL migration to create the table:

```bash
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f backend/database/monthly_agent_reports.sql
```

### 2. Backend Server

The backend routes are automatically registered. No additional setup needed.

### 3. Frontend

The components are ready to use. The page is accessible at:
```
/dashboard/reports
```

## Design Consistency

All components follow the existing design system:
- ✅ Same color scheme (blue primary, gray neutrals)
- ✅ Consistent button styles
- ✅ Matching table layouts
- ✅ Identical modal designs
- ✅ Same filter patterns
- ✅ Unified typography
- ✅ Consistent spacing and shadows
- ✅ Same icons (lucide-react)

## Permissions

Reports are protected by:
- Route protection: `canViewAgentPerformance` permission
- Required roles: Admin, Operations Manager, Agent Manager

## Future Enhancements

The tab structure is ready for expansion:
1. **Leads Report**: Conversion rates, source analysis
2. **Revenue Report**: Revenue trends, forecasting
3. **Performance Report**: Team and individual KPIs

Simply implement the respective tab components when ready.
