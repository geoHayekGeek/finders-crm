# Referral Fields Enhancement - Complete

## Problem
Ahmad Al Masri's October report was only showing 1 referral, but there were 8 internal referrals on his closed properties from October.

## Root Cause
The system was only tracking **outgoing referrals** (properties the agent referred to others) but not **incoming referrals** (referrals on the agent's own properties).

## Solution
Added two new fields to track both types of referrals:

### Database Changes
Added to `monthly_agent_reports` table:
- `referrals_on_properties_count` (INTEGER) - Count of internal referrals on this agent's closed properties
- `referrals_on_properties_commission` (DECIMAL) - Commission paid to referrers from this agent's closed properties

### Backend Changes
Updated `backend/models/reportsModel.js`:
- Modified `calculateReportData()` to calculate the new fields
- Updated `createReport()` to include new fields in INSERT
- Updated `recalculateReport()` to include new fields in UPDATE

### Frontend Changes
Reorganized report modals to clearly separate expenses from income:

**ðŸ”´ Red Section - "Commissions on Agent Properties"**
All commissions that the agent pays out:
- Agent Commission
- Finders Commission
- Referral Commission
- Team Leader Commission
- Administration Commission
- **Referrals On Properties Commission** (with count shown in parentheses)
- **= Total Commission** (sum of all expenses)

**ðŸŸ¢ Green Section - "Commissions on Referrals Given By Agent"**
Commission the agent receives (separate from expenses):
- Properties this agent referred to other agents
- Fields: `referral_received_count`, `referral_received_commission`

This UI organization makes it clear:
- All paid commissions (including referrals on properties) â†’ Total Commission
- Referrals given is income, shown separately

Updated components:
- `frontend/src/components/reports/EditReportModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/CreateReportModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/types/reports.ts`

## Ahmad Al Masri October 2025 Report Results
