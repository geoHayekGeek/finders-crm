# Property Owner-Lead Linking Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a feature to link property owners to leads (customers), converting the previous text-based owner field into a searchable dropdown connected to the leads database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File:** `backend/database/add_owner_id_to_properties.sql`

- Added `owner_id` column to properties table as a foreign key referencing leads table
- Created index on `owner_id` for better query performance
- Made `owner_name` and `phone_number` nullable for backward compatibility
- Existing properties can continue using the old text fields
- New properties use the `owner_id` to link to leads

### 2. Backend Model Updates ✅
**File:** `backend/models/propertyModel.js`

- Updated `createProperty()` to accept and store `owner_id`
- Modified all query methods to join with leads table:
  - `getAllProperties()`
  - `getPropertiesByAgent()`
  - `getPropertiesAssignedOrReferredByAgent()`
  - `getAllPropertiesWithFilteredOwnerDetails()`
  - `getPropertiesByTeamLeader()`
  - `getPropertiesForTeamLeader()`
  - `getPropertyById()`
  - `getPropertiesWithFilters()`
- Used `COALESCE(l.customer_name, p.owner_name)` to fetch owner name from leads when available, fallback to direct field for backward compatibility
- Updated search filter to search by owner names from leads table

### 3. Backend Controller Updates ✅
**File:** `backend/controllers/propertyController.js`

- Updated `createProperty()` to handle `owner_id` parameter
- Made `owner_name` and `phone_number` optional since they're now fetched from leads
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing properties

### 4. Frontend Component Creation ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/OwnerSelector.tsx`

Created a new reusable component similar to `AgentSelector`:
- Fetches all leads from the database using the existing `/api/leads` endpoint
- Searchable dropdown with filtering by customer name, phone, and status
- Displays owner details (name, phone, status) with color-coded status badges
- Includes refresh button to reload leads
- Handles selection and clearing of owners
- Auto-fills owner_name and phone_number when an owner is selected

### 5. TypeScript Type Updates ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/types/property.ts`

- Added `owner_id?: number` to `Property` interface
- Added `owner_id?: number` to `EditFormData` interface
- Added comments explaining the backward compatibility approach

### 6. Property Modals Updates ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/PropertyModals.tsx`

#### Add Property Modal:
- Replaced `owner_name` and `phone_number` text inputs with `OwnerSelector` component
- Added `owner_id` to form data state
- Auto-fills `owner_name` and `phone_number` when owner is selected
- Updated property creation to send `owner_id` to backend

#### Edit Property Modal:
- Replaced `owner_name` and `phone_number` text inputs with `OwnerSelector` component
- Loads existing `owner_id` when editing a property
- Auto-fills owner information when a different owner is selected

#### View Property Modal:
- No changes needed - displays owner_name fetched from backend (automatically from leads if owner_id exists)

### 7. Frontend Property Display ✅
No changes needed in property cards and tables:
- Backend automatically returns the correct owner_name from leads table via `COALESCE`
- Existing components display owner information seamlessly

## How It Works

### Creating a New Property
1. User opens "Add Property" modal
2. Clicks on "Owner (Lead)" dropdown
3. Searches and selects a lead from the dropdown
4. Owner name and phone number are automatically filled
5. Property is created with `owner_id` linking to the selected lead

### Editing an Property
1. User opens "Edit Property" modal
2. Existing owner is pre-selected if property has `owner_id`
3. User can change owner by selecting a different lead
4. Owner information updates automatically

### Viewing Properties
1. Properties display owner names from the leads table automatically
2. Search functionality works with owner names from leads
3. All existing properties continue to work with their stored owner_name

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:

1. **Old Properties:** Properties created before this update still display correctly using their stored `owner_name` and `phone_number`
2. **Database Fields:** `owner_name` and `phone_number` columns remain in the database (nullable)
3. **Query Logic:** Uses `COALESCE(l.customer_name, p.owner_name)` to prefer lead data but fallback to direct fields
4. **Migration Path:** Existing properties can be edited to link to leads, or continue using text-based owner information

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency:** Owner information is centralized in the leads table
2. **Reduced Duplication:** No need to manually enter owner details for each property
3. **Better Data Quality:** Owner information stays in sync across properties
4. **Improved Search:** Can search properties by lead information
5. **Relationship Tracking:** Easy to find all properties owned by a specific lead
6. **Refreshable Data:** Can update owner information in one place (leads) and it reflects in all properties

## Database Relationships

```
leads (customers)
  ├─ id (primary key)
  ├─ customer_name
  ├─ phone_number
  ├─ status
  └─ ...

properties
  ├─ id (primary key)
  ├─ owner_id → leads(id) [NEW FOREIGN KEY]
  ├─ owner_name (kept for backward compatibility)
  ├─ phone_number (kept for backward compatibility)
  └─ ...
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [x] Can create new property with owner selected from leads
- [x] Can edit property and change owner
- [x] Owner dropdown loads all leads
- [x] Owner dropdown search filters correctly
- [x] Owner dropdown refresh button works
- [x] Owner name and phone auto-fill when lead selected
- [x] Existing properties still display correctly
- [x] Search by owner name works
- [x] Backend returns owner information from leads
- [x] All property queries include lead joins

## API Endpoints Used

- **GET** `/api/leads` - Fetches all leads for the owner dropdown
- **POST** `/api/properties` - Creates property with `owner_id`
- **PUT** `/api/properties/:id` - Updates property with `owner_id`
- **GET** `/api/properties` - Returns properties with owner names from leads

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. Add ability to create new lead directly from property modal
2. Show property count on each lead in the dropdown
3. Add bulk update feature to link old properties to leads
4. Add lead details preview when hovering over owner selector
5. Add filter to show only certain lead statuses in owner dropdown
6. Add validation to prevent selecting inactive leads as owners

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/database/add_owner_id_to_properties.sql` (NEW)
- `backend/models/propertyModel.js` (MODIFIED)
- `backend/controllers/propertyController.js` (MODIFIED)

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/OwnerSelector.tsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/PropertyModals.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- `frontend/src/types/property.ts` (MODIFIED)

## Deployment Notes

1. Run the database migration before deploying code changes:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node -e "const pool = require('./config/db'); const fs = require('fs'); const sql = fs.readFileSync('./database/add_owner_id_to_properties.sql', 'utf8'); pool.query(sql).then(() => { console.log('✅ Migration completed'); process.exit(0); }).catch((err) => { console.error('❌ Migration failed:', err); process.exit(1); });"
   ```

2. Deploy backend changes first to ensure API compatibility

3. Deploy frontend changes after backend is updated

4. No downtime expected - backward compatibility maintained

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that the database migration ran successfully
2. Verify that leads data is populated
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify API responses include `owner_id` field
5. Check that `OwnerSelector` component is loading leads correctly
