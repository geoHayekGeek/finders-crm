# Settings System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive settings system for the Finders CRM with **Company Branding** and **Email Automation** features.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
**File**: `backend/database/system_settings.sql`
- Created `system_settings` table with key-value structure
- Support for multiple data types (string, boolean, number)
- Categorized settings (company, email, branding, reminders, etc.)
- Includes default settings with sensible defaults
- Automatic timestamp tracking

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### Settings Model (`backend/models/settingsModel.js`)
- CRUD operations for settings
- Category-based filtering
- Type conversion utilities
- Helper methods for email notification checks
- Helper methods for reminder checks

#### Settings Controller (`backend/controllers/settingsController.js`)
- Get all settings or by category
- Update single or multiple settings
- File upload support for logo and favicon
- Delete logo/favicon functionality
- Multer configuration for file handling (5MB limit, image types only)
- File storage in `backend/public/uploads/branding/`

#### Settings Routes (`backend/routes/settingsRoutes.js`)
- `GET /api/settings` - Get all settings
- `GET /api/settings/category/:category` - Get settings by category

### 3. Email Automation Integration
**File**: `backend/services/reminderService.js` (Modified)
- Integrated settings checks into email reminder system
- Checks global email notifications setting
- Checks component-specific settings (calendar_events)
- Checks individual reminder type settings (1_day, same_day, 1_hour)
- Gracefully skips email sending when disabled
- Logs helpful messages when emails are skipped

### 4. Frontend Implementation

## Technical Details

- Unique filenames with timestamp

### Security
- All routes require admin authentication
- File type validation
- File size limits

### Integration with Email System
The email reminder service automatically checks these settings before sending emails:
1. Checks if global email notifications are enabled
2. Checks if the specific component (e.g., calendar_events) has emails enabled
3. Checks if the specific reminder type (e.g., 1_day) is enabled

Only if all checks pass will the email be sent.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more reminder types (2 days, 30 minutes, etc.)
- Add email template customization
- Add timezone settings
- Add date/time format preferences
- Add more file types for branding
- Add bulk export/import settings
